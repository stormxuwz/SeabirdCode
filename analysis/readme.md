# analysis code

This analysis folder contains the data to generate the plot in the paper

Folder structures:

	-data
		-- sampleData: folder containing the raw SeaBird Sensor CNV files for plot 9 and 11
		-- detectedFeatures.csv: the features detected for all profiles
		-- featuresAtExpertDepths.csv: the temperature gradient at the depth from operators' notes 
		-- SU_mean_UHY_LEP.csv: the mean UHY and LEP in Lake SU, generated by the code in main.R
		-- thermoFlux_SU.csv: the thermoflux calculated in the rootfolder/main.py
		-- thermoFlux_maxDepth_SU.p: the maximum depth of each station in Lake SU, as a pickle file

	-paperResults: folder containing the plots generated by main.R and plotFigure9and11.py

	-main.R: the R code to generate scatterplots of human vs algorithm, the glyph plots of TRM, DCL and thermo flux in Lake SU

	-getGradientAtNotesDepth.py: python script to find the temperature gradient at the depth from operators' notes
	-plotFigure9and11.py: python script to plot figure 9 and 11
